.SH "NAME"
.PP
pam_unixsock \- PAM module to send credentials to a Unix socket

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBpam_unixsock.so\fP [\fBhidden\fP] [\fBfailopen\fP] [\fBtimeout\fP] [\fBdebug\fP] [\fIPROMPT\fP]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This code is a pluggable authentication module (PAM) that redirects the credentials to a local Unix
socket. The server listening on that socket is then free to do many more complex things, because
it's free from the calling process' address space. The Unix socket defaults to
\fB\fC/var/run/pam_unix.sock\fR. The protocol is described below and is fairly simplistic. If \fIPROMPT\fP is
given, the text is used to prompt the user for another (2FA) authentication token. This module only
implements the \fIauth\fP module.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBdebug\fP
log debug information with \fB\fCsyslog(3)\fR.
.TP
\fBtimeout\fP
set the timeout in seconds for how long to wait for a response from the server, the default is
\fB\fCtimeout=2\fR.
.TP
\fBhidden\fP
when prompting for another authentication token, hide the input.
.TP
\fBfailopen\fP
when set ignore failures to \fIconnect\fP to the Unix socket and return PAM_SUCCESS.


.SH "PROTOCOL"
.PP
\fBpam_unixsock\fP implements an extremely simple socket protocol whereby it passes an username, the
PAM service, and the second token (i.e. \fBPROMPT\fP) (separated by new lines) to the Unix socket and
then your server simply replies with a 0 or 1:

.PP
.RS

.nf
[pam\_unixsock]   john\_smith\\n
[pam\_unixsock]   <pam\_service>\\n
[pam\_unixsock]   <prompt>\\n
[your server]    1\\n

.fi
.RE

.PP
If your server answers within \fB\fCtimeout\fR with a \fB\fC1\fR you are considered authenticated.

.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
With Ubuntu (24.04), in \fB\fC/etc/pam.d/sshd\fR:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# Standard Un*x authentication.
@include common\-auth

# add this line
auth required pam\_unixsock.so debug Enter 2FA token

.fi
.RE

.SH "SSH"
.PP
In the \fB\fCsshd\fR configuration be sure to add:

.PP
.RS

.nf
KbdInteractiveAuthentication yes
UsePAM yes

.fi
.RE

.PP
Note that with public key authentication this is bypassed, and you log in without being asked for a
second token.

.SH "NOTES"
.PP
In Fedora the socket can't be written to by sshd because selinux does not allow it.
